# OmiseGO

This repository houses the code challenges for OmiseGO. These are
small hands-on projects that are very relevant to the tasks you will be working on here.

### Ground Rules

* We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time,
  if you need it 
* Average completion time so far has been around one to two weeks
* Submission can be done done via [git format-patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch), a private repository or a simple archived project.
  Send your submission to the hiring team.

### What to expect

We do understand that our code challenges are time intensive and not always easy to
execute. We do recognize and value the time and effort applicants put into their
submission. Our Code Challenges reflect some of the tasks and skills you'd need while
working with us. We believe that these *take-home* challenges will give you a deeper
understanding of our product, what you'd be working on in the future and what level of
commitment we look for in applicants.

### What we look for

Rather than a complex solution, which added a million features and is written in 10,000
lines of code, we look for:

* **Clarity:** You can write clear code that any devs could read and understand in one go
* **Simplicity:** You can write gimmick-free and straightforward code with no ambiguities
* **Defensiveness:** You can cover edge cases and treat user inputs with care

### What happens after your submission

Once you have submitted your solution by sending us the **git-format-patch**, our
Engineers will review the code. Due to the number of submissions we receive, and
time-intensive review process, it might take us **1 week** to give you feedback on the
submission. Based on the feedback, we will invite you for a meeting to talk more about
your submission and continue the recruitment process.
